# 🧾 Ω Risk Register Workflow

## The Ledger of System Debt

> This workflow is the **Single Source of Truth** for all system risks.
> It converts "opinions" into **Immutable Entities**.
> Unregistered risk is **denial**, not safety.

---

## Core Mission

Architecture Review exposes candidates.
Integrity Lock hardens defenses.
Freeze Gate checks permissions.
**Risk Register holds the memory.**

This workflow exists to prevent:

- “We know about this risk” (Oral Tradition)
- Forgotten dangers
- Silent normalization of unsafe states
- Risk dilution via documentation

---

## ID Authority Doctrine (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

This workflow is the **ONLY** authority allowed to generate Risk IDs.

**ID Format:** `RISK-<CATEGORY_CODE>-<SHORT_HASH>`
- Example: `RISK-AUTH-X7B2`

Other workflows (`integrity`, `freeze`) MUST reference these IDs exactly.
Creating ad-hoc IDs in other workflows is a **System Violation**.

---

## Inputs (STRICT)

This workflow runs in two modes:

### Mode A: Registration (New Risks)

- Input: **Architecture Review Output** (Risks labeled ⚠️ or ❌)

### Mode B: State Mutation (Updates)

- Input: **Freeze Gate Directive** (Founder Override → ACCEPTED)
- Input: **Integrity Lock Directive** (Hardening Complete → MITIGATED)

---

## Risk Entity Schema (MANDATORY)

You MUST fill **ALL** fields for every new risk.

| Field | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Risk ID** | Generated by YOU (e.g., `RISK-DATA-99A1`) |
| **Title** | 5-7 words max |
| **Category** | See *Field Semantics* |
| **Origin** | Workflow that found it (e.g., `Review-ID-XYZ`) |
| **Affected Invariants** | Which guarantee is broken? |
| **Failure Mode** | Silent? Loud? Data Corruption? |
| **Impact** | LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL |
| **Likelihood** | RARE / POSSIBLE / LIKELY / CERTAIN |
| **Owner** | Specific Role or Person |
| **Current Status** | OPEN (Default) |

If any field is unknown → write **UNKNOWN** (unknown ≠ ignored).

---

## Field Semantics (STRICT)

### Category Codes

- `SEM` (Semantic)
- `TYPE` (Type Safety)
- `AUTH` (Authority Escalation)
- `COUP` (Coupling)
- `OBS` (Observability)
- `HUM` (Human Dependency)
- `REC` (Rollback / Recovery)

### Impact

- **LOW:** Localized confusion
- **MEDIUM:** User-visible inconsistency
- **HIGH:** Systemic incorrect behavior
- **CRITICAL:** Authority abuse / Data corruption

### Detection Signal

- How do we KNOW it activated?
- ❌ **NONE** = Red Flag (Silent Failure)

---

## Mutation Rules (State Transitions)

Risks are **Immutable Objects** with **Mutable State**.
You may change Status ONLY under these conditions:

1. **OPEN** → **ACCEPTED**
    - *Required Proof:* Valid **Founder Override** from `/omega-freeze-gate`.
    - *Log:* "Accepted by Override [Date] [Reason]".

2. **OPEN** → **MITIGATED**
    - *Required Proof:* Valid **Integrity Hardening Plan** from `/omega-integrity-lock`.
    - *Log:* "Mitigated by Hardening [Invariant-ID]".

3. **OPEN** → **RETIRED**
    - *Required Proof:* Code removal or architectural change proving the risk path no longer exists.

⚠️ **Deletion is FORBIDDEN.** History must be preserved.

---

## Forbidden Actions

- ❌ Suggesting fixes (Not your job)
- ❌ Designing solutions (Not your job)
- ❌ Grouping risks to “simplify” (Hides detail)
- ❌ Downplaying severity (Lying)
- ❌ Generating IDs manually without format

---

## Output Contract (The Handshake)

You MUST produce the following artifacts for downstream consumers:

### 1️⃣ The Risk Ledger (Human Readable)

A Markdown table containing all Active Risks.

### 2️⃣ Machine-Readable Export (MANDATORY)

A JSON block for `integrity` and `freeze` to parse:

```json
{
  "ledger_version": "1.0",
  "risks": [
    {
      "id": "RISK-AUTH-X7B2",
      "status": "OPEN",
      "severity": "CRITICAL",
      "owner": "Jemy",
      "blocking_gate": "J.3"
    }
  ]
}

3️⃣ Gate Dependency Map

    List of Risks blocking the Next Phase.

    Example: Blocking J.3: [RISK-AUTH-X7B2, RISK-DATA-11C4]

Exit Conditions

This workflow completes ONLY when:

    All candidates are converted to Entities with IDs.

    The JSON Artifact is generated.

    Ownership is explicit.

    No risk is "known but untracked".

Final Doctrine

    Architecture fails silently. Risk written down becomes visible. Risk ignored becomes fate.
