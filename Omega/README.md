# Ω Omega Lab

**Owner:** Jemy (Founder / Architect)
**Classification:** R&D / Blackworks
**Status:** ACTIVE

## Mission
The Omega Lab serves as the proving ground for "Active Infrastructure" and future v2 architectures. It is a sandbox where strict "v1 Zero Drift" rules are suspended in favor of innovation, prototyping, and rigorous architectural theory.

## Structure

### 📂 00_Architecture
**The Brain.**
High-level architectural decisions, Master Specs for future phases, and strategic roadmaps.
*Contains: Manifests, RFCs, Decision Logs.*

### 📂 01_Experiments
**The Playground.**
Isolated, disposable prototypes. Code here is *exploratory* and not bound by production guarantees.
*Contains: POCs, Harnesses, Spike Solutions.*

### 📂 02_Blueprints
**The Design.**
Formalized specifications derived from successful experiments. These become the "Spec" for production engineering.
*Contains: Schema Definitions, API Contracts, Process Flows.*

### 📂 03_Fabric
**The Core.**
 reusable standard libraries, base classes, and utilities that form the DNA of the new system.
*Contains: Traits, Base Models, Service Providers.*

### 📂 99_Logs
**The Memory.**
Raw output logs from experiments, performance benchmarks, and audit trails.

## Rules of Engagement
1.  **Code Fearlessly:** Break things here so they don't break in Production.
2.  **Document Everything:** An experiment without a conclusion is a waste.
3.  **Promote Wisely:** Only code that survives "01_Experiments" and gets detailed in "02_Blueprints" moves to Production.
